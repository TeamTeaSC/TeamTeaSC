### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an ECE major at Carnegie Mellon University with a minor in Mathematical Sciences.  I am interested in both software systems (networking, distributed, databases, OS) and hardware systems (RTL design, computer architecture, FPGAs, ASICs).  I am proficient in C, Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, SML, and SystemVerilog.
